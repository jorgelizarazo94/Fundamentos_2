This repository hosts a deep learning project focused on object detection using PyTorch. The main objective is to illustrate the application of transfer learning with a customized version of the ResNet50 architecture for enhanced performance on specific image recognition tasks.

Highlights
Transfer Learning: Utilizes a pre-trained ResNet50 model, modifying it to suit the nuances of our target task by adding custom feature extraction layers, adaptive pooling, and dropout to fine-tune the network effectively.
Data Augmentation: Implements advanced data augmentation strategies using the Albumentations library, introducing transformations like horizontal flipping, rotation, and random brightness-contrast adjustments to improve the model's generalization.
Differential Learning Rates: Employs a tailored optimization strategy, with different learning rates set for various components of the model to ensure a balanced training process that preserves pre-learned features while adapting new ones.
Custom Loss Function: A composite loss function is configured to handle multiple objectives, a necessary approach for complex tasks like object detection which requires both classification and localization accuracies.
Goal
The project aims to provide a thorough example of how to set up a robust deep learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation. It's an exemplary resource for those looking to understand and apply practical deep learning with PyTorch.

Feel free to explore the code, use it as a starting point for your projects, or contribute to its further development!
